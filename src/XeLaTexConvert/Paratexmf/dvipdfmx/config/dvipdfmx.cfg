%% Image Handler
%%
%% Command-line template for a-to-b conversion:
%%
%% Supported target format ('b') is currently PDF.
%% Percent sign '%' is special character:
%%
%%   %i  Input file name (FQPN). Name of file to be converted to PDF.
%%   %o  Output file name (FQPN). Temporary file to store conversion
%%       result. Removed after inclusion is finished. (regardless of
%%       success or failure)
%%   %b  The "base" name of the input file, e.g., "foo" instead of
%%       "foo.eps".
%%   %%  Replaced with single '%'.


%% The following line works with Frank Siegert's pstill
% D "c:/usr/local/bin/pstill -c -o %o %i"

%% Example for GhostScript (PS-to-PDF)
%%
%% The following example decode all DCT (i.e., JPEG) encoded images
%% and then recompress images with Flate (zlib, same as PNG) encode
%% filter. If you are using recent version of gs, then please remove
%% -dAutoFilterXXXImages and -dXXXImageFilter. 
%% /FlateEncode is introduced to avoid quality loss of "EPS JPEG"
%% images.
%%
%% Also note that PAPERSIZE=a0 is specified below. This convert PS
%% files (including EPS) to A0 papersize PDF. This is necessary to
%% prevent gs from clipping PS figure at some papersize. (A0 above
%% simply means large size paper)
%%
%% GhostScript (Windows):
D "gswin32c -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sPAPERSIZE=a0 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false -dAutoFilterColorImages=false -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode -dUseFlateCompression=true -sOutputFile=%o -c .setpdfwrite -f %i -c quit"

%% The following line works on compressed or uncompressed postscript with
%% GhostScript
% D "gzcat -f %i | gswin32c -q -sPAPERSIZE=a0 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.2 -dUseFlateCompression=true -sOutputFile=%o - -c quit"

%% The following line works with Adobe Acrobat Distiller
% D "distill -o%o %i"

%% Batik + Fop (SVG-to-PDF):
%% If you want both PS and SVG, of course you need to write script
%% or program that selectively invokes converters.
% D "java -classpath classpaths -jar /path/to/batik-rasterizer.jar -m application/pdf -d %o %i"

%% There are no way to directly know suggested size of (raster) images.
%% You may want to use %b here, since you can try reading the ebb file
%% to see what is natural (physical) size of images. 
% D "ras2pdf -r 300x300 -b %b.bb -o %o %i"

%% Just print input and output filename. (inclusion always fails)
% D "echo 'converting %i to %o'"

%% Papersize Option:
%%   p papersize-spec
%%
%% papersize-spec is 'paper-format' or length-pair, e.g., 'a4', 'letter',
%% '20cm,30cm'. Recognized unit is 'cm', 'mm', 'bp', 'pt', 'in'.
%% 
p a4

%% Add margin specified by 'g' option to annotation created via various
%% \specials. Many TeX macro pages set the annotation bounding box equal
%% to the TeX box that encloses the material. That's not always what you
%% want.
%%
%% The initial state of bookmark (outline) item is to be 'open' if depth
%% of item from root node (depth 0) is less than or equal to the integer
%% specified with 'O' option.

%% PDF Version Setting
%%
%% PDF (minor) version stamp to use in output file.
%% This also implies maximal version of PDF file allowed to be included.
%% Dvipdfmx does not support 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 since TrueType font embedded
%% as CIDFontType2 requires at least version 1.3. Transparent imaging
%% model requires version 1.4. So if you want soft-masking support for
%% PNG image with alpha channels, you should set version to 4 or higher.

%%
%% Dvipdfmx Compatibility Flags
%%
%%   0x0002  Use semi-transparent filling for tpic shading command,
%%           instead of opaque gray color. (requires PDF 1.4)
%%   0x0004  Treat all CIDFont as fixed-pitch font.
%%           This is only for backward compatibility. Don't use that.
%%   0x0008  Do not replace duplicate fontmap entries.
%%           Dvipdfm's (not 'x') behaviour.
% C 0x0000

%%
%% PDF Security (Encryption) Setting
%%
%% Those options won't take effects unless you use flag 'S'.
%%
% Key bits for PDF encryption (40 or 128)
K 128

%% Permission flag for PDF encryption: Revision will be 3 if the key size
%% is greater than 40 bits.
%%
%% 0x0004 (Revision 2) Print the document.
%%        (Revision 3) Print the document (possibly not at the highest quality
%%        level, depending on whether bit 12[0x0800] is also set).
%% 0x0008 Modify the contents of the document by operations other than those
%%        controlled by bits 6[0x0020], 9[0x0100], and 11[0x0400].
%% 0x0010 (Revision 2) Copy or otherwise extract text and graphics from the
%%        document, including extracting text and graphics (in support of
%%        accessibility to disabled users or for other purposes).
%%        (Revision 3) Copy or otherwise extract text and grphics from the
%%        document by operations other than that controlled by bit 10[0x0200].
%% 0x0020 Add or modify text annotations, fill in interactive form fields,
%%        and, if bit 4[0x0008] is also set, create or modify interactive
%%        form fields (including signature fields).
%%
%% (Revision 3 only)
%% 0x0100 Fill in existing interactive form fields (including signature
%%        fields), even if bit 6 is clear.
%% 0x0200 Extract text and graphics (in support of accessibility to disabled
%%        users or for other purposes).
%% 0x0400 Assemble the document (insert, rotate, or delete pages and create
%%        bookmarks or thumbnail images), even if bit 4 is clear.
%% 0x0800 Print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital
%%        copy of the PDF content could be generated. When this bit is clear
%%        (and bit 3 is set), printing is limited to a low-level representation
%%        of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality.
