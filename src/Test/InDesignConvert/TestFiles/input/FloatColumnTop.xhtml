                                                License (SISSL) with the intention of building an
                                                open source development community around the
                                                software. The new project was known as
                                                OpenOffice.org, and its website went live on October

                                                with the following goals: better interoperability

                                                improved speed and lower memory usage; greater

                                                particularly with GNOME; an easier-to-find and use
