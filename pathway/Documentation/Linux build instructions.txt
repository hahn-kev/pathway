SETTING UP GIT CLIENT
---------------------
In order to make git work on Linux, I had to use
sudo apt-get -y install git git-gui gitk
This installs the git client. (Note that on Lucid git-arch must be used instead of git.)
Then you can create a .netrc file in your home folder as described on the google code site.
Then you can use the command on the google code site to clone a copy of the repo.
For my machine I created a folder called git
mkdir git
and then
cd git
and cloned the pathway repo there.

SETTING UP BUILD SYSTEM
-----------------------
To set up Linux for building packages, I used:
sudo apt-get -y install devscripts debhelper autotools-dev mono-complete

BUILDING PATHWAY
----------------
If the packages has already been installed it can be removed with
make clean clean-build
Once this is all setup, the command to build the package is:
debuild -eBUILD_NUMBER=1.1.2.2205 -etarget=Daily -i -us -uc -b
It should be executed in the ~/git/pathway/pathway folder (or whereever the PublishingSolution.sln file is located).
You will replace the build number with the appropriate # for the build you are making.
You can also change -etarget=Daily (this updates the build # in all the AssemblyInfo.cs files as well as building Release7BTE). You can use Release7SE, Corporate7BTE or Corporate7SE to build these other packages.
If you put it in another location, you will need to add
-ebinsrc=~/git1/pathway/pathway
replacing git1 with the folder you have used.
For 64-bit build the 
-ePlatform=Any\ CPU
parameter should be given to the build.

INSTALLING
----------
The .deb package will be built in the ~/git/pathway folder (the parent of the one that executed the debuild command).
If you launch this file (double click on it), you can install Pathway.
After installing Pathway, create the CurrentUser registry key by typing:
ConfigurationTool
at the terminal prompt (CTRL-ALT-T).

SETTING UP PATHWAY XELATEX
--------------------------
cd ~/git/pathway/pathway/XeLaTexConvert
make tlsetup

BUILDING PATHWAY XELATEX
------------------------
cd ~/git/pathway/pathway/XeLaTexConvert
make clean clean-build
debuild -ePlatform=x86 -eDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip -eOutputPath=. -i -us -uc -b
Use Platform=Any\ CPU for 64-bit

INSTALLING PATHWAY XELATEX
--------------------------
The .deb package will be build in the ~/git/pathway/pathway folder (the parent of the XeLaTexConvert that executed the debuild command).
If you launch this file (double click on it), you will install pathway-xelatex
