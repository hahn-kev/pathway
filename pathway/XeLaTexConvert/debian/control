Description: Prepare language data (Fieldworks & Paratext) for TeX publishing
 Pathway appears as a menu item in Fieldworks and Paratext. PathwayB also
 allows it to run from the Terminal. It takes language data frequently
 presented in XHTML & CSS format and converts it to a TeX file and then launches
 this application to create the Pdf file with XeLaTeX.
