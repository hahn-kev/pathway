In order to build the installer for XeLaTeX:
1. Extract the files from Install-tl.zip in the Third party folder
2. Copy Setuppwtex.bat and tlpw2.pro to that folder
3. If you haven't set the SVN_DIR environment variable, set that to point to where you have the Pathway repository
4. Then you should be able to double click the Setuppwtex script.
5. From the %SVN_DIR% you use the
PathwaySprint.bat #.#.#.# XeLaTeX
command where #.#.#.# is replaced with the version number (ie. 0.7.10.1607 for example)

When the process is finished the .msi file will be in the Sprint folder.

This file will need to be transfered to the pathway.sil.org site in the sprint folder on the site.
