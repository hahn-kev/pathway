%% If you want to customize frenchb, please DO NOT hack into the code,
%% copy this file into a directory searched by TeX, preferably a
%% personal one on multi-user systems, and customize it as you like.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% WARNING: If you exchange your documents with colleagues using
%% a different TeX installation, it is best NOT TO HAVE a frenchb.cfg
%% file, and add instead the customization commands to the preamble
%% of your documents after babel and frenchb have been loaded.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% Uncomment the following line if you dislike frenchb automatically
%% adding a space before French double punctuation (see frenchb.dtx
%% for more information).
%%
%%\NoAutoSpaceBeforeFDP
%%
%% frenchb inserts a normal space before a colon in French (following
%% I.N. specifications), but some people prefer a thinspace instead;
%% uncomment the following line if you prefer a thinspace.
%%
%%\renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace}
%%
%% Uncomment the following line to force lasy font emulation for
%% French guillemets in OT1 encoding; Polish guillemets are
%% FAR BETTER LOOKING, you should normally leave this line commented out.
%%
%%\LasyGuillemets
%%
%% The following option is for backward compatibility ONLY
%% (it might conflict with the russian option of babel).
%% Uncomment the following line if you want to get back to
%% the default guillemets used in versions $<$ 1.6b for OT1-encoding
%% (no effect in T1-encoding).
%%
%%\CyrillicGuillemets
%%
%% If you dislike Polish guillemets in OT1-encoding, you can easily
%% pick up yours from other fonts, examples below: Palatino or
%% cyrillic CMR T2A encoded font.
%% The four arguments are: encoding, font name, character codes of
%% the opening and closing guillemets in the selected font.
%%
%%\FrenchGuillemetsFrom{T1}{ppl}{19}{20}
%%\FrenchGuillemetsFrom{T2A}{cmr}{190}{191}
%%
%% Uncomment the following line if you don't want frenchb to change
%% LaTeX standard settings for vertical spacing in 'itemize' lists.
%% LaTeX standard settings were used by frenchb in versions < 1.3,
%% so you may want to uncomment the following line to process older
%% documents.
%%
%%\FrenchItemizeSpacingfalse
%%
%% frenchb tunes vertical spaces in all lists (at \list level),
%% uncomment the following line if you prefer LaTeX standard settings
%% (this flag is new in version 1.3). When \ifFrenchItemizeSpacing is
%% `true' (default setting), this flag has no effect on itemize lists.
%%
%%\FrenchListSpacingfalse
%%
%% The command \FrenchLabelItem can be used to set the `labelitems'
%% for all levels in French. For instance, to get long dashes, use:
%%
%%\renewcommand{\FrenchLabelItem}{\textemdash}
%%
%% You can also have different `labelitems' for each level in French:
%%
%%\renewcommand{\Frlabelitemi}{\textemdash}
%%\renewcommand{\Frlabelitemii}{\bfseries\textendash}
%%\renewcommand{\Frlabelitemiii}{\textbullet}
%%\renewcommand{\Frlabelitemiv}{}
%%
%% Uncomment the following line if you want a thinspace to be added
%% in the running text before the footnote number or symbol.
%%
%%\AddThinSpaceBeforeFootnotes
%%
%% Uncomment the following line if you want footnotes to be typeset
%% according the specifications of the French `Imprimerie Nationale'.
%%
%%\FrenchFootnotes
%%
%% Uncomment the following line if you want the command \nombre to
%% insert thin spaces (1/6em) instead of normal spaces (0.3em)
%% between slices of 3 digits when typesetting numbers in French.
%%
%%\ThinSpaceInFrenchNumbers
%%
%% If you are bored to type {,} every time you want a decimal comma in
%% math mode, uncomment the following line (and don't forget to add a
%% forced space after the comma in lists and intervals: $(x,\ y)$ and
%% $[0,\ 1]$). I suggest NOT TO UNCOMMENT the following line,
%% and to switch between the decimal comma and the standard comma
%% using \DecimalMathComma and \StandardMathComma inside the document.
%%
%%\DecimalMathComma
%%
%% If you do not want the appearance of lists to depend on the current
%% language, add ONE of these two commands: \FrenchLayout (for a
%% document mainly in French) or \StandardLayout (for a document
%% mainly in English).
%%
%%\FrenchLayout
%%\StandardLayout
%%
%% With the standard LaTeX classes (article.cls, report.cls, book.cls)
%% you can change the separator used in figure and table captions in
%% French with \CaptionSeparator, for instance (the default value of
%% \CaptionSeparator in French is '\space\textendash\space'):
%%
%%\addto\captionsfrench{\def\CaptionSeparator{\space\textemdash\space}}
%%
%% You might want to change some of the translations of caption names,
%% you can do it this way, for instance:
%%
%%\addto\captionsfrench{\def\figurename{{\scshape Figure}}}
%%\addto\captionsfrench{\def\tablename{{\scshape Table}}}
%%\addto\captionsfrench{\def\proofname{Preuve}}
%%
%% If French guillemets are available on your keyboard, you can use
%% them instead of the commands \og and \fg: REPLACE << and >> in
%% the following code by your ready-made guillemets (2 occurrences
%% for each) AND uncomment the resulting code.
%% WARNINGS:
%% 1) This will reduce the portability of your source files!
%% 2) This adds two active characters.
%% 3) If you add this stuff to the preamble of a document, you'll
%%    need to wrap it in \makeatletter ... \makeatother.
%%
%% \ifx\mule@def\undefined
%%   \initiate@active@char{<<}
%%   \initiate@active@char{>>}
%%   \AtBeginDocument{%
%%     \def<<{\og\ignorespaces}%
%%     \def>>{{\fg}}%
%%     }%
%% \else %%% For the CJK package, see MULEenc.sty.
%%   \mule@def{11}{\og\ignorespaces}
%%   \mule@def{27}{{\fg}}
%% \fi
%%
%% The rest is for compatibility with Bernard Gaulle's french.sty:
%% if you want to typeset with babel/frenchb files originally written
%% for french.sty, you will probably want to uncomment these lines.
%%
%% Uncomment these lines if you want the aliases \numero and \Numero
%% (as in french.sty) for \no and \No.
%%
%%\let\numero=\no
%%\let\Numero=\No
%%
%% Uncomment the following lines if you want to substitute `\bsc' to
%% either (or both) of french.sty macros `\fsc' and `\lsc'.
%%
%%\let\fsc=\bsc
%%\let\lsc=\bsc
%%
%% Uncomment the following line if you want to substitute `\up' to
%% french.sty macro `\fup'.
%%
%%\let\fup=\up
%%
%% Uncomment the following lines if you intend to use  commands \french
%% and \english to switch between languages, as in french.sty.
%%
%%\def\french{\leavevmode\selectlanguage{french}}
%%\def\english{\leavevmode\selectlanguage{english}}
%%
%% Uncomment the following lines if you intend to use the command
%% \AllTeX to refer to all flavours of TeX, (this command has been
%% made popular by french.sty).
%%
%%\newcommand*{\AllTeX}{%
%%                (L\kern-.36em\raise.3ex\hbox{\sc a}\kern-.15em)%
