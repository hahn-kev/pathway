%%%
%%%                        CONVENTIONS
%%%
%%%                        Books are tagged by the first author's last
%%%                        name, a colon, a four-digit publication
%%%                        year, a colon, and up to 3 upper-case letters
%%%                        taken from the first three upper-case words
%%%                        in the title (ignoring words like A, And,
%%%                        The).  When this is insufficient to
%%%                        disambiguate entries, additional lower-case
%%%                        letters are suffixed to the tags.
%%%
%%%                        For Dutch authors, a van part is included
%%%                        in the author tag.  For names with accented
%%%                        letters, accents are dropped in the author
%%%                        tag.
%%%
%%%                        Entries are stored ordered by the BibTeX
%%%                        tag name, independent of the entry type
%%%                        (the GNU Emacs function sort-bibtex-entries
%%%                        can be used to ensure correct ordering).
%%%                        However, entries that are cross-referenced
%%%                        by others are stored at the end of the
%%%                        file, since that order is required by
%%%                        BibTeX.
%%%
%%%                        With few exceptions, value fields for
%%%                        acknowledgement, address, journal, and
%%%                        publisher keywords should use macros
%%%                        defined in the string preamble below.  This
%%%                        helps to ensure consistency, and reduces
%%%                        the entry sizes.  Address entries must
%%%                        always include the country.
%%%
%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert
%%%                        Solovay's checksum utility."

%%% A delimited macro \toenglish ... \endtoenglish is NECESSARY here.
%%% The more conventional undelimited form \toenglish{...} has braces
%%% that prevent BibTeX's downcasing operation, and the alternate form
%%% {\toenglish{...}} is considered a `special character' by BibTeX,
%%% and all of {...} gets downcased.  We avoid the name \english to
%%% prevent conflicts with language options in packages like Babel.
%%%
%%% To suppress output of English translations of non-English titles,
%%% use
%%%     "\def \toenglish #1\endtoenglish{\unskip}"
%%% instead.

                 publishing scholarly material, especially works
                 containing heavy mathematics. It is popular at
                 universities and research facilities around the world,
                 but it is hardly known outside academic circles. Since
                 {\TeX} is available on desktop platforms (as well as on
                 mainframes and minicomputers), it is competitive to
                 some extent with desktop publishing software. There are
                 still many applications where {\TeX} produces results that
                 are better than those of standard desktop packages.
                 There are a few things {\TeX} can do that couldn't be
                 practically done with desktop software. There is a new
                 {\TeX} implementation, {\TeX}tures, which moves {\TeX} a little
                 closer to the desktop mainstream. It holds out the hope
                 that {\TeX} may yet have the potential to become as easy
                 to use as other desktop packages. The author discusses
                 the innovations built in to {\TeX}, its strengths and
                 weaknesses, and its uses. (0 Refs.)",

                 sophistication in the specification of the final
                 format. It has companion packages (most notably {\LaTeX})

                 including the production of new fonts, pictures and
                 extended production systems. The project discussed was
                 aimed at rescuing the full power of {\TeX} packages in the
                 newly emerging X-Windows technological context. The
                 authors describe software which was produced to take
                 full advantage of the facilities of both systems by
                 translating {\TeX} output into bit-mapped images which can

                 Press `Manual of Style' has been the standard reference
                 tool for authors, editors, copywriters, and
                 proofreaders. Updated many times since 1906, it now
                 goes into its thirteenth edition---the first to
                 introduce a change in title. Bowing to what has become
                 nearly universal usage, we now call the `Manual' what
                 everybody else calls it, `The Chicago Manual of
                 Style'---or, for short, `The Chicago Manual'.\par Two
                 pervasive features characterize the present edition: it
                 reflects the impact of the new technology on the entire
                 editing and publishing process, and it spells out, in
                 greater detail and with many more examples, the
                 procedures with which it deals. It is, in short, much
                 more a ``how-to'' book for authors and editors than was
                 its predecessor. In chapter 2, on manuscript
                 preparation and copyediting, for example, new sections
                 have been added on how to mark a manuscript and how to
                 mark type specifications on a script. Chapter 12
                 (``Tables''), completely rewritten, begins with advice
                 on how to make a table from raw data. Chapters 15
                 through 17, on documentation, have been reorganized and
                 greatly expanded, offering many more alternative
                 methods of citation and a wealth of examples. In
                 chapter 18 (``Indexes''), clear step-by-step procedures
                 for the mechanics of index making are set forth. The
                 terminology and methodology of technological advances
                 (in word processing, computerized electronic
                 typesetting, and the like) are reflected most
                 prominently in chapter 20, ``Composition, Printing, and
                 Binding'' (new to this edition), and in the Glossary.
                 Other notable features of the present edition are
                 chapter 4 (``Rights and Permissions''), rewritten in
                 light of the new copyright law, and chapter 9
                 (``Foreign Languages''), which includes a new table of
                 dicritics, a pinyin (Chinese) conversion chart and data
                 on several more languages.\par Throughout, `The Chicago
                 Manual' aims to give clear and straightforward
                 guidelines for preparing and editing copy---with the
                 emphasis on the sensible, the practical, and the
                 economical. As did its predecessors, the thirteenth
                 edition of the `Manual' states the style preferences of
                 the University of Chicago Press and reflects the
                 current practices and requirements of the great
                 majority of American publishers.",

                 contains an introductory chapter for the beginner, its
                 main purpose is to give the reader advanced information
                 on {\LaTeX} (and partially on {\TeX}) in order to
                 prepare sophisticated macros, style files, and to make
                 a clever use of fonts.

                 Here is a reduced table of contents (translated to
                 English):

                 The publisher received camera-ready pages that were
                 prepared by the author with a 300-dpi laser printer.
                 The page style dimensions were suitably enlarged while
                 the photo plates were reduced so as to minimize the
                 granulosity of the signs. In practice the book was
                 prepared with 12pt option and reduced by the
                 photografic ratio of 0.8 so that the final real font
                 size is 9.6pt.

                 The whole book was prepared with the standard Computer
                 Roman fonts on purpose in order to show the potential
                 user what he can get with a standard \TeX{}/\LaTeX{}
                 kit. The simple pictures were prepared with the
                 ``picture'' environment. The cover and the title page
                 were designed by a graphic expert of the publishing
                 company.",

                 assistance from the production department of Academic
                 Press, Boston. The covers were done by the publisher.
                 It was typeset by the author using Plain {\TeX} plus
                 specially written macros. The code for all macros used
                 for the book are reproduced in it so that the book
                 itself contains all the information---page layout
                 specifications, fonts used, and so on---about its own
                 typesetting.

                 Over half the book consists of {\TeX} input and output
                 shown side-by-side, providing an explicit example of
                 how a part of the book was typeset.

                 The Academic Press logo on page iii, the
                 cataloging-in-publication data on page iv, and the
                 diagrams on page 33 were pasted in place by the
                 production department of Academic Press.

                 The diagrams were drawn using {\LaTeX}. Sample
                 printouts of pages were made on various laser printers.
                 When everything seemed satisfactory, the dvi files were
                 copied onto IBM diskettes and were mailed to Academic
                 Press, and from them to the American Mathematical
                 Society. The final copy was produced by the A.M.S.
                 using an APS micro-5 phototypesetter. All fonts used in
                 the book are from the Computer Modern family.

                 Parts of the covers of the book, inside and outside,
                 were done in {\TeX} by the author (the code for this is
                 not included in the book). The outside cover was
                 designed by Camille Pecoul of Academic Press and
                 produced at Allison Associates in Boston. The font used
                 for the title (on the covers) is Meridien. The
                 background pattern was obtained by shooting a handmade
                 marble paper as a black-and-white halftone and then
                 overprinting with the Pantone Matching System (PMS).
                 The placement of material on the cover was done by hand
                 by Ms. Pecoul using a mechanical board. The drop shadow
                 effect was done at Allison Associates.",

                  pursued interests in fields as diverse as
                  philosophy, political economy, and mechanical
                  computing. While attempting to realize a machine for
                  calculating and printing error-free mathematical
                  tables, he visited factories to learn metalworking
                  techniques, invented a system of mechanical notation
                  to represent the states of the machine, and devised
                  a method for correct typesetting. As the editor of
                  this series notes, the scope of Babbage's work makes

                 independently, but most of these systems are unable to
                 manipulate them in a unified document. With the
                 introduction of Smalltalk. Star, Lisa, Macintosh, and
                 {\TeX} it has become possible to mix text and graphics
                 data in a single document. The ODA/ODIF standard has
                 also been developed for the preparation, processing and
                 interchange of text as used in office documents. The
                 presented system is based on similar ideas but it
                 allows the documents to be created using relational
                 geometry as well. Any change in a given data item
                 causes the relational expressions existing in a
                 document to be reevaluated and this makes the system an
                 interactive WYSIWYG document editor. Currently the
                 system is used for documenting various instances of
                 animations generated by an animation package developed
                 at Bilkent University. (28 Refs.)",

  annote =       "Harry Gaylord comments: ``Much nonsense and hype has
                 been written about hypertext.  Much software has been
                 written to produce hypertext documents which are high
                 on pzaz and whistles and bangs, but requires
                 painstaking work on the part of the writer.  Revising
                 the documents often means that they have to be
                 time-consumingly debugged in obscure ways before they
                 can be used again.  Documents cannot be used in any
                 other system except the one they were written in.
                 More importantly often the documents have to be
                 broken up first into structures which are not
                 inherent to the document.  A library card catalogue
                 contains cards, a newspaper or a novel doesn't.  To
                 force a novel into cards violates the very structure
                 of the document.  Other so-called hypertext systems
                 are organised very simply and do what they claim to
                 do very well, but documents produced in them will
                 have to be substantially revised when more facilities
                 are required.

                 To create order out of this, ISO JTC1/SC18/WG8
                 created a group to draw up a standard for hypertext.
                 The result of this work is ISO 10744:1992 HyTime.
                 About the same time, the Text Encoding Initiative
                 appointed a hypertext committee of four members.  Its
                 chair was DeRose and the members include Durand, Ed
                 Fox, and Eve Wilson.  The committee has proposed
                 important revisions and extensions to HyTime, and the
                 TEI Guidelines include all the query facilities of
                 HyTime plus other extensions.  If these extensions
                 are found useful in the wider community, they will be
                 incorporated in the next revision of HyTime.

                 This is the first book to appear on HyTime.  Eliot
                 Kimber is preparing one which is scheduled to appear
                 in August, and Charles Goldfarb is working on another
                 which is being modeled on the SGML Handbook in that
                 it will include the commented standard itself.

                 This book is divided into three parts.  Part 1 is
                 called Introducing HyTime.  This is the most general
                 and provides an excellent starting point for anyone
                 who needs to know what HyTime is, what its relation
                 to SGML is, what its modules are, and why anyone who
                 is producing or using electronic documents needs SGML
                 and/or HyTime products.  For many this will be enough
                 to convince them that they should hand the book on to
                 their software purchasers and implementors to get to
                 work.

                 Part 2 is entitled Basic HyTime.

                 The chapters include Basic Measurement, Hyperlinks,
                 Locating Data Objects, The HyTime Query Language, and
                 Modifying a DTD for HyTime.  Many hours of my time
                 would have been saved if I had received this section
                 when I received the draft of the standard itself.
                 When one reads this part carefully, one has a clear
                 idea of most of the details involved in HyTime.  One
                 of my strongest criticisms of HyTime is the obscure
                 short names.  They could have been clear if the
                 committee had not decided to limit name lengths to
                 less than 8 letters as was specified in SGML
                 Reference Syntax.  As it is only insiders in the work
                 on the standard itself can understand what they
                 actually refer to.

                 Part 3 is entitled Intermediate HyTime.  Here are the
                 extra detailed treatments of aspects of HyTime which
                 implementors need to know.

                 Appendixes include the HyTime Meta-DTD with its
                 corrections and Graphic Notations.  The book is
                 concluded with a bibliography, glossary, and index.

                 If I understand the authors, the highest level of
                 hypertext which can be reached at the moment is
                 Intermediate, not Advanced.  The field is too young.
                 They are, of course, right in this.

                 It is no accident that these authors are part of that
                 Brown group which has spread out to Boston now.  It
                 has been the major center for producing systems for
                 structuring and linking highly complex documents and
                 have built extensive experience since the 1960's.

                 The didactic arrangement is impressive.  Basic issues
                 are discussed clearly first and nuances are added
                 later when they are needed by the reader.  It is not
                 often that in a very complex subject the authors so
                 clearly have understood what is forest and what is
                 trees, and have been such good guides to the
                 uninitiated and initiated alike.

                 With this book I have a proper coursebook for my
                 students this year.  If you want to know about
                 electronic documents which are usable in more than
                 one system and future-oriented, then you should buy
                 this book without waiting for anything else to
                 appear.  It provides an excellent introduction for
                 the general reader, and thorough treatment for those
                 who need it.''",

                 algorithms, the algorithms described perform their task

                 compiled into corresponding changes in the formatted

                 fast interactive text formatter. A text formatting
                 system called ALPHA is presented which uses the
                 algorithms described. ALPHA is a window-based system

                 supports typesetting of APL publications and documents
                 in a mixed hardware, multiple vendor APL environment.
                 It requires minimal maintenance and is in the public
                 domain. The system has two components, the {\LaTeX}
                 document style option apl.sty and the APL2TEX front
                 end. The option apl.sty provides the full symbol sets
                 of the APL dialects APL2/370, APL2/PC, Dyalog APL,
                 I-APL, Sharp APL, and APL.68000 Levels I and II. All
                 APL symbols are constructed with the symbols of the
                 standard {\LaTeX} font family. No special fonts are
                 needed. The APL2TEX front end is a workspace containing
                 a preprocessor for converting APL objects to {\LaTeX}
                 logical document elements. APL2TEX is currently

                 specifications for graphical objects and associations
                 of visualization and application objects. The layout
                 approach is based on a notation similar to the
                 {\TeX} text formatting language. It has been extended and
                 generalized for specifying graphical layout of user
                 interfaces and arbitrary objects. The simplest scheme
                 offers specifications similar to {\TeX}'s
                 box-and-glue metaphor. Size and position of virtual
                 boxes and glue can be specified by simple constraints.
                 The authors show how the CLOS (Common Lisp Object
                 System) meta-level architecture can be exploited to
                 associate visualization and application objects. They
                 show how several useful techniques such as indirect
                 values, slot and method demons, and instance-specific
                 meta-objects can be implemented using CLOS. These
                 visualization techniques require no source code
                 modifications of application systems. They demonstrate
                 the feasibility of this approach using application

  abstract =     "The authors discuss which text interchange standards
                 will enable physics authors to submit their articles
                 directly to publishers via a computer network. An
                 analysis of a questionnaire circulated recently by the
                 European Physical Society shows that there is an
                 abundance of different hardware and software in use by
                 physics authors for electronic manuscript preparation.
                 A standard interchange format which would permit
                 authors to continue to use their preferred system as
                 well as enabling document interchange seems imperative
                 if one wishes to achieve the goal of electronic
                 submission of machine readable documents directly to
                 publishers. A possible candidate could be SGML, the ISO
                 standard for text interchange. Use of this standard
                 would generate additional benefits such as the
                 automatic generation of document databases. The
                 relationships between the ISO standards SGML and ODA,
                 the de facto standard {\TeX} and the page description
                 language PostScript are explained. A proposal is made
                 for the structure of a standard physics article
                 intended for use with SGML and {\TeX}. A short discussion
                 is given on the thorny problem of the inclusion of
                 mathematics and graphics that are particularly common
                 in physics documents. Finally they indicate some
                 limitations of SGML and the prerequisites that are
                 required to make the exchange of electronic documents
                 in SGML format universally possible. (18 Refs.)",

                 journal? Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical
                 Sciences is the book for you!

                 This handy volume provides information on virtually
                 every issue you will face when writing a technical
                 paper or talk, from choosing the right journal to
                 handling your references. You'll also get an overview
                 of the entire publication process--invaluable for
                 anyone hoping to publish in a technical journal.

                 To write a truly impressive paper, you'll need to
                 understand the anatomy of a research paper and the
                 steps involved in revising a draft. This book offers
                 discussions of these fundamental topics, along with
                 illustrative and provocative examples. Also included
                 are chapters on standard English usage, using computers
                 for writing and research, and writing technical
                 material when English is a foreign language.

                 This handbook provides much-needed advice on handling
                 the basic ingredients of a research paper, like
                 definitions, theorems, examples, and equations. In
                 addition, appendices provide essential reference
                 material, including summaries of \LaTeX{} symbols and
                 Emacs commands, addresses of mathematical societies,
                 and a list of papers that have won expository writing
                 prizes.

                 was designed for use with the hardware system
                 consisting of NEC 9801 (MS/DOS) and Canon's laser
                 printer. The price of this software including a printer
                 driver is 132000 yen (where the driver costs 34000
                 yen). The following matters are also discussed: a
                 simple processing example for preparing documents using
                 {\TeX}; various advantages in using {\TeX} (e.g. {\TeX} is a
                 PDS); wide choice in applicable computer models from
                 super computer to IBM-PC or NEC 9801 (due to its device

                 model (the boxes and glue model) and the author
                 introduces the box representation of a printed symbol

                 location of an hbox (line of text) in a vbox (column of
                 text). This hypothesis is accepted if most connected
                 components in the hbox form character boxes. Character
                 prototypes are used to determine whether a box in an
                 hbox is a character box. The algorithm correctly
                 extracted an average of 96--99 percent of text-lines

                 abstraction of the contour from bit patterns of an
                 image scanner and an automatic composition of Hangul
                 from its character elements. PostScript (a page

                 effectively support output devices such as LBP and
                 Display PostScript. Logical screen, multilevel
                 adjustment and conversion algorithm from Bezier curve
                 to polyline, etc. are introduced to obtain a good
                 quality Hangul Metafont with a friendly user interface.

                 {\TeX} (for mainframes and PC's), MASS-11, WordMarc+ and
                 T3 were created specifically to handle these

                 ignored by the early popular software developers, who
                 designed such packages as WordStar, Microsoft Word and
                 early versions of WordPerfect. Now, the developers of
                 the largest-selling software package in the world,
                 WordPerfect, are also beginning to cater to the
                 scientific and engineering communities with the latest

                 than just following coding guidelines. It also requires
                 that potential clients of a component can easily
                 understand the documentation associated with the
                 component. Literate programming, as suggested by D.
                 Knuth (1983), is concerned with combining code and
                 documentation in a form that is more easily read by
                 humans, rather than by compilers. The paper illustrates
                 the benefits of a literate programming approach to
                 writing reusable software by presenting a generic
                 package written in a literate programming style. ADA
                 WEB, a language for literate programming that combines
                 Ada and {\TeX}, was used to prepare the paper. (14

                 decisions one line at a time, the method considers the
                 paragraph as a whole, so that the final appearance of a
                 given line might be influenced by the text on
                 succeeding lines. A system based on three simple
                 primitive concepts called ``boxes,'' ``glue,'' and
                 ``kerns'' provides the ability to deal satisfactorily
                 with a wide variety of typesetting problems in a
                 unified framework, using a single algorithm that
                 determines optimum breakpoints. This algorithm avoids

                 dynamic programming. Extensive computational experience

                 is usually much better for human consumption than its
                 implementation in a conventional programming language.
                 The aim is to use ordinary mathematical notation as a
                 program development tool for certain applications. The
                 author illustrates some ideas via an experimental
                 translator which translates mathematical formulas to
                 Pascal statements. More precisely, a combination of
                 ordinary mathematical notation and conventional style
                 control structures and declarations is used as the
                 programming language. But, because of the
                 two-dimensional nature of ordinary mathematical
                 notation, the proper display of source programs
                 requires some special tools. Given the popularity of
                 the {\TeX} type-setting system, the author decided to
                 encode the source programs in plain {\TeX}. The
                 experimental translator has four phases: the first
                 phase is a lexical analyzer (tokenizer) which deals
                 primarily with the decoding of the {\TeX} notation; the
                 second phase is a preprocessor which analyses the
                 declarations and performs other pattern matching
                 functions; the third is the actual parser; and the
                 fourth phase is the code generator. (6 Refs.)",

                 formatting Ada programs in T/sub E/X. These macros were
                 implemented by the author in early 1987, and they have
                 been refined a few times since. They have also been
                 extended for the language extensions of Ada developed
                 by the Program Analysis and Verification Group at
                 Stanford University. These macros exist as one
                 collection in a file which is included into the
                 document using the mod input command. This file is
                 available on request from the author. The design of the
                 macros were motivated by the program example
                 environment in Scribe. It is for this reason that they
                 have been named APE, which is an acronym for `Ada
                 Program-Example'. The macros are of two kinds-global
                 macros and local macros. The global macros are visible
                 throughout the scope in which the input command has
                 been inserted. (4 Refs.)",

                 The synthesis can be done with minimal interaction from
                 the user: only the essential information must be given,
                 and the program will produce a Spice net list and a {\TeX}
                 design report. For a typical design, this takes 30
                 minutes on a mini-computer. Unlike other synthesis
                 programs, it searches in an extremely large set of
                 possible circuits (over 1,000,000 configurations), and
                 is not restricted to one device technology. To ensure a
                 high rate of success in the designs, it uses
                 mathematically sound search rules instead of heuristic
                 ones, and accurate approximations of the circuit
                 behavior. These features require considerable
                 computational effort, and therefore it is necessary to

                 providing a `standard' framework for analysis and
                 design is highlighted. In addressing the usefulness of
                 the Meta-IV in the specification, design and
                 implementation of graphical icons for a general purpose
                 user interface management system, the authors chose to
                 focus on the domain of Chinese characters-ideograms
                 which have many characteristics in common with
                 graphical icons. Two different (conceptual) models were
                 developed. The first considered the ideogram as a stack
                 of transparencies. The second viewed it as the modular
                 composition of basic mathematical/graphical entities.
                 Specifications of both models in the Meta-IV were
                 developed and the declarative graphical programming
                 language METAFONT was used in the implementation. To
                 facilitate an appropriate entry level into learning and
                 using METAFONT for the task in hand, the VDM Meta-IV
                 was used to provide an abstract model of the language.
                 The results reported indicate that use of the VDM
                 Meta-IV as an expression of a common semantic base was
                 a success. (9 Refs.)",
