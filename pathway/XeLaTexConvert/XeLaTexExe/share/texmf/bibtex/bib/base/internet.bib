  note =         "The author takes on the task of teaching the current
                 state of the new data communication technologies, and
                 does a generally excellent job of it. Chapter 1
                 introduces the basic concepts of packet networking,
                 explaining that technology in detail and drawing
                 contrasts to the T-1 TDM technology explained in The
                 Guide to T-1 Networking by the same author. ASCII and
                 X.25 are referred to in this chapter, with only the
                 briefest description, so the reader should have some
                 rudimentary knowledge of data communication. However
                 the basic differences between packet switching and
                 circuit switching, and between connection-oriented and
                 connectionless transmission, are clearly explained so
                 the reader can skip over confusing terminology without
                 loss.

                 Chapter 2 does an excellent job of explaining the basic
                 concepts underlying the various types of packet, frame
                 and cell technologies, the relative advantages and
                 disadvantages of each, layered protocols, the OSI
                 reference model and says a few words about the
                 functions of SNA, the Internet protocols, the IEEE LAN
                 standards and Signaling System 7.

                 Chapter 3 uses T-1 as an example to explain the
                 SONET/STS and SDH framing technology. The reader should
                 approach this chapter with a good understanding of T-1
                 synchronization. HDLC is also described briefly in this
                 chapter.

                 Chapter 4 explains frame relay, including the Local
                 Management Interface, and again makes a comparison to
                 X.25 (which is never described in detail). This is
                 followed by an detailed explanation of the basics of
                 FDDI (but SMT isn't covered). The MAN standards DQDB,
                 IEEE 802.6 and SMDS, which are all closely related, are
                 explained as a unit. ATM is described, with its
                 relationship (or lack thereof) to SONET. The StrataCom
                 proprietary FastPacket protocol is mentioned briefly,
                 followed by some general design principles for
                 light-weight protocols, with brief descriptions of XTP
                 and HSTP.

                 If you have the necessary background to read it, as
                 explained above, I can recommend this book as an
                 introduction to the new networking technologies that it
                 covers.

                 explains the overall Novell architecture, and
                 introduces the Network General Sniffer network analysis
                 tool. Chapters 2 and 3 explain the Ethernet, Token Ring
                 and ARCNET physical media. Chapter 4 discusses the IPX,
                 SPX and network maintenance protocols; the author
                 unfortunately does not explain why you DON'T want to
                 use Novell's default Ethernet encapsulation. He also
                 notes that IPX checksumming is disabled on the example
                 he shows, but doesn't mention that this is usual Novell
                 practice, or explain the implications. This chapter was
                 written before packets greater than 512 bytes and block
                 mode were implemented.

                 Chapter 5 describes the NetWare operating system; the
                 Bindery; communications utilities; file attributes,
                 access rights, locking and synchronization; print
                 services; job servers; and accounting. Chapter 6
                 describes the Message Handling Service (MHS) and some
                 gateways between it and other type of messaging system.
                 Chapter 7 briefly describes data organization, Btrieve,
                 XQL and NetWare SQL. Chapter 8 describes the Netwise
                 RPC product and its relationship to some other forms of
                 RPC from other vendors.

                 Chapter 9 describes the AT\&T STREAMS protocol
                 mechanism and its Novell implementation. Chapter 10
                 briefly describes the NetWare support for AppleTalk.
                 Chapter 11 describes NetWare for VMS, Portable NetWare
                 (which supersedes NetWare for VMS), and how Novell and
                 DECnet networks can be gatewayed to each other.

                 Chapter 12 briefly describes Novell support for WANS.
                 Chapter 13 discusses gateways between Novell and
                 TCP/IP, SNA (described as ``not quite as nonproprietary
                 as TCP/IP'' in what is surely the understatement of the
                 year!) NetBIOS and OSI.

                 Much of the discussion is fairly superficial. There is,
                 however, a good bibliography which provides references
                 to more detailed documents. The glossary and index look
                 serviceable. All chapters are illustrated with
                 reproductions of Sniffer displays.

                 discusses types of of access to the network and steps
                 to initiate access to the network. It gives information
                 on providers/vendors the services for research,
                 education, commerce, and individual use. Approximate
                 costs are discussed in terms of such factors as
                 services desired, hardware used, dedicated lines vs
                 dialup, distance from host, frequency of use, peak vs
                 non-peak charges, and telephone charges. Acceptable use
                 is discussed, explained, and illustrated. The seven
                 chapters in Part I are: \begin{itemize} \item
                 Introduction to the Internet (what it is, who is in
                 charge, what is and is not a part of it, kinds of
                 networks) \item How to Join the Internet (MX, dialup,
                 individual access, connecting networks) \item Costs
                 (determining factors, network and individual examples)
                 \item Service Providers (vendors of network
                 connections, dialup vendors, providers of services
                 within states) \item Military Access (by each branch of
                 the military) \item NSFNET Acceptable Use Policy \item
                 Non-U.S. Sites (European cooperation and contacts,
                 Baltic and Nordic countries, Caribbean Basin, the
                 Pacific Rim, 30 specific countries, U.S. providers of
                 international connections)

                 Part II explains the concepts of the Internet, such as
                 the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS) and
                 addressing, protocols (the TCP/IP suite, the telnet
                 protocol, file transfer protocol (FTP)), requests for
                 comments (RFCs), for your information (FYI), and
                 standards (STDs). The six chapters in Part II are:
                 \item The Internet--More Information (historical,
                 physical, and growth) \item Basic Internet Concepts
                 (RFCs, FYIs, and STDs; security, protocols, addressing,
                 the Domain Name System, directory services) \item
                 Applications (electronic mail, mailing lists and news
                 groups, file transfer protocol, telnet, and information
                 servers such as archie, Prospero, WWW, WAIS, and the
                 Internet gopher) \item Internet Organizations (network
                 associations, network administrative organizations,
                 administrative bodies, standards organizations,
                 security response centers, network information centers,
                 and user groups) \item Internet Resources (NNSC
                 Internet resource guide, NNSC tour of the Internet,
                 TCP/IP CD, network reading list, online libraries,
                 network seminars, and supercomputer centers) \item
                 Further Reading (general introductory references,
                 technical introductions, Domain Name System, network
                 security, and some GOSIP documentation)
