                 numerical computations based on the interval approach.
                 It is managed by an international editorial board from
                 Bulgaria, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United
                 States, and printed in Russia. The journal includes
                 various items in the fields of theoretical research,
                 computer tools, applications, interdisciplinary
                 research and other relevant areas.

                 The IC has been prepared with {\TeX} since 1992.
                 Recently a new style has been designed based on
                 standard {\LaTeX} {\tt article} style with changes in
                 fonts, headings layout, running heads etc. It uses
                 10.8pt Baskerville for body text (the unusual font size
                 is selected for better wedding with CM math) and
                 horizontally-squeezed Palatino for headings. For
                 mathematical formulae, standard Computer Modern is
                 preserved. Proofs are made using em{\TeX} DVIHPLJ on a
                 Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIp, and final pages are
                 printed at 600dpi. Using V{\TeX} is now under
                 consideration.

                 Papers are accepted in any {\TeX} variety; {\LaTeX}

                  mathematics journal being launched by the University
                  at Albany, State University of New York.\par

                  The journal is broadly based in subject matter,
                  covering algebra, modern analysis, and
                  geometry/topology.\par

                  The papers will be presented via the \TeX{}
                  mathematical typesetting language, developed by Donald
                  Knuth. \TeX{} has become the standard for computer
                  typesetting of mathematical publications.\par

                  Access will be provided through a variety of
                  electronic means, including \path|listserv|, anonymous
                  \path|ftp| and \path|gopher|. In particular, access
                  will be much more convenient than that provided by a
                  conventional print journal. Because papers will be
                  published as they are accepted by the editorial board,
                  publication delays will be minimal.\par

                  The articles will be archived, date stamped, and
                  maintained by the University at Albany, State
                  University of New York. The University takes
                  responsibility for insuring the integrity of the
                  journal's archive in perpetuity.\par

                  The journal will have an ISSN number and will be
                  accessed by the major bibliographic publications in
                  the field.\par

                  The development of this journal is being underwritten
                  by the Office of Information Systems of the University
                  at Albany, State University of New York.\par

                  The New York Journal will be accessible by a
                  combination of \path|listserv| and \path|gopher|\slash
                  \path|ftp|.\par

                  By \path|listserv|, we will distribute abstracts of
                  the papers, together with instructions for retrieving
                  them via \path|ftp| and \path|gopher|.\par

                  The abstracts will be available on four separate
                  \path|listserv| lists: one will distribute abstracts
                  for every paper. The other three are specialty lists,
                  giving abstracts for papers in algebra, analysis and
                  geometry\slash topology, respectively. The reader may,
                  of course, subscribe to any combination of these
                  lists.",

                  To avoid duplication, we will only be archiving the
                  postings on NYJMTH-A, the list carrying all the
                  abstracts. The archive for NYJMTH-A will also contain
                  the style specifications for submissions and the
                  templates for frontmatter.\par

                  The \path|gopher|\slash \path|ftp| archive will
                  contain both the abstract and a \path|.dvi| file for
                  each paper. Both abstract and \path|.dvi| will remain
                  unchanged from the official date of publication, as
                  may be verified by checking the date stamps.\par

                  The gopher archive may be accessed by typing
                  \path|gopher+ \path|nyjm.albany.edu=.  It is also
                  available under the ``Academic Offerings, Departments
                  and Programs'' selection of the main gopher menu of
                  the State University of New York at Albany.\par

                  The same archive will be accessible by anonymous \path|ftp|
                  on the machine \path|ftp_nyjm.albany.edu| in the directory
                  \path|/pub/nyjm|. (This feature has not yet been enabled.)\par

                  a driver is present in most mathematics

                 Printer: Digicopy, Corp., 858 Phoenix Dr., Ann Arbor,
                 MI 48108.

                 Frequency: Twice yearly, issued on astronomical
                 solstices (late June and late December). An effort is
                 made to have the transmission carry the time and date
                 stamp of the exact minute of the astronomical solstice
                 (sort like a first day cover marking for a stamp
                 collector).

                 The ISSN number was assigned by the Library of Congress
                 beginning with the winter issue, 1991.",
  note-2 =       "The rationale behind the ISBN assignment is as
                 follows. {\em Solstice\/} is also available in hard copy
                 (\$15.95) a year for those wishing it. The book
                 containing the full year's issues is given an ISBN. The
                 first number in the list is the number for the 1990
                 volume. The third number is the number for the 1991
                 volume. In addition, in the summer, single issues are
                 available. The second ISBN is the number for the single
                 summer 1991 issue.

                 Copyright: copyright is taken out on the hard copy.
                 Electronic files can be compared to the hard copy in a
                 library should a reader question whether or not a
                 document has been altered.

                 Here is some additional information.",
  note-3 =       "1. Reason for the name. Because geography and
                 mathematics have a history of mutual research
                 stimulation (Konigsberg bridge problem, four color
                 problem, \ldots), material from one discipline can shed
                 light on the other. Astronomical solstices are extreme
                 positions at which time northern and southern
                 hemispheres receive maximum and minimum daylight or
                 night. Between the solstices there is varying dominance
                 of day and night; so too, there is varying dominance of
                 mathematical and geographical interaction in articles
                 in Solstice. Of course, the extreme of a purely
                 geographical or a purely mathematical article is also
                 suitable for submission.

                 2. Articles are refereed; the journal is

                 experience in publishing matters using TeX, it was very
                 helpful to me to be hired by the University of Chicago
                 Press to typeset, using TeX, a volume in their
                 ``Lecture Notes in Physics''--(Walter Welford's {\em Useful
                 Optics\/}--quite suitable, I think!). Generally, {\em The
                 TeXbook\/} is all that I need; once I encountered a
                 difficulty with some sort of `bold' notation invented
                 by an author. For that, a combination of advice from a
                 colleague in mathematics and from the University of
                 Michigan's Computing Center, helped me to figure out a

  note-6 =       "6. A number of the volumes in the IMaGe monograph

                 hard copy for 1991) are TeX-ed. I typeset documents
                 using Plain TeX; the hard copy is obtained by uploading
                 the ASCII file into the University of Michigan's
                 mainframe and printing it out on their Xerox 9700
                 (series) machine. They have a number of them at various
                 sites across campus. The print quality is only 200 dpi,
                 so in that regard TeX-ed documents don't look as good
                 as they should--hence, difficulty in convincing
                 non-TeXers of its value. Every effort is made to get
                 hard copy right after a periodic maintenance of the
                 machines. Then photos are inserted (pasted

                 can be downloaded from DocuTech hard drive onto a
                 floppy! What would be great of course is if Xerox would
                 make it so that a TeX file on a floppy could be
                 directly fed into the DocuTech--by-passing the

                 was no peer-reviewed online journal of mathematics,
                 informing them of {\em Solstice\/}'s existence. There appears
                 to be a great deal of difficulty in archiving this sort

                 Botany and the Buffalo Museum of Science--this journal
                 dates from 1987. It is not a TeX-ed journal; it is
                 peer-reviewed. No doubt, though, you are aware of
                 Michael Strangelove's directory of electronic
                 journals--think he lists a subset that are TeX-ed. He's
                 at the University of Ottawa in the Department of
                 Religious Studies, I believe.",

                 of document production; when hard copy is produced (to
                 suit demand--``just-in-time'' publishing) it is printed
                 on 100\% recycled paper with a large percentage of fiber
                 from post-consumer (20\% to 40\%, depending on the lot)
                 products. Obviously, the electronic distribution of
                 {\em Solstice}, free, across Bitnet and Internet, is cheap
                 and environmentally sensitive.
