              the computer graphics industry to represent curved shapes.
              For many applications, it would be useful to be able to
              reliably derive this representation from a closely-spaced
              set of points that approximate the desired curve, such as
              the input from a digitizing tablet or a scanner.  This
              paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically
              generating efficient piecewise parametric cubic polynomial
              approximations to shapes from the sampled data.  We have
              developed an algorithm that takes a set of sample points,
              plus optional endpoint and tangent vector specifications,
              and iteratively dervies a single parametric cubic
              polynomial that lies close to the data points as defined
              by an error metric based on least-squares.  Combining this
              algorithm with dynamic programming techniques to determine
              the knot placement gives good results over a range of
              shapes and applications."
