ConfigurationTool is part of ﻿Pathway 1.0.4
January 11, 2012 

Prerequisites
LibreOffice 3.4.4 or later is preferred (http://www.libreoffice.org/download/).
In Libre Office, use Tools, Options, Security, Macro Security to set the security level to medium.
In Libre Office, use Tools, Options, Languages and set CTL font support of you are in a region with right-to-left writing systems (use Asian if you need those writing systems). See help for more explanation.
PDF reader (either Adobe http://get.adobe.com/reader/ or FoxIt http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/index.php)
The Java JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) is required for some outputs (e-book validation for example).

For your information
Pathway is an export option in Fieldworks or ParaTExt on the File menu.
Pathway is an experimental Feature in the FieldWorks Translation Editor. To enable it, go to the Tools ->Options ->Advanced and select Pathway Exports.

Process Notes
In Fieldworks, use Tools -> Configure Dictionary to set the fonts, sizes, styles, characters before and after fields, and field order. From the Lexicon view of the Lexicon, make sure the data is sorted by the headword field and that any filters have been applied so the data that appears in the dictionary view is actually the data you want to print.
In the Translation Editor, use File: Properties: Name to set the name that appears in the book header or in the Go Bible book selection screen (It should not be so long that it won’t fit easily on one line of a cell phone.)
The conversion allows the user to customize the process. It looks for a folder called ‘Process’ that is a sibling of where the exported file will be. In that folder it looks for a batch file called BeforePwConvert.bat. This file is passed the name of the file exported from Flex. The user can write a script to be executed on the file as long as the result remains valid XHTML, the conversion will process it.
For InDesign, the program also looks for AfterPwConvert.bat in the same Process sibling folder. It will be executed after the program has generated all the xml files but before they are compressed into an IDML file. The AfterPwConvert can modify the xml files contained in the %tmp%\InDesign\Dictionary folder tree. When the batch file completes, these xml files will be compressed into the IDML file. The content is contained in %tmp%\InDesign\Dictionary\stories and the styles are contained in %tmp%\InDesign\Dictionary\Resources\styles.xml

Work arounds
It is possible to put the guide words into the header in multiple writing systems. Create a separate field with the headword and position it after the normal headword. Set the writing system so that it looks correct in the Language Explorer preview. Then after exporting, Press F11 and click on the second icon in the style dialog tool bar. This is the one that displays the list of character styles. Now click into the second headword and make. The style name for this headword will be highlighted in the style dialog. Right click on it and choose Modify. Then change the name so that it begins with “headword_”
In Word, you can create a header using the StyleRef field code. StyleRef is covered in the Word help file.
If the line spacing varies and you would like to lock it down, you can use the –ps-fixed-line-height property to specify the line height.
If the embedded spans feature is selected, the snippet may need to be edited to change the language codes to those valid for your project.
Try breaking long documents into pieces (by letters or every two letters). 
We have provided a check box to allow the styles to be “hard coded” rather than using the style sheet. Generally this is undesirable but if Libre Office is crashing, checking this box may prevent the crash.
When exporting to Pathway from Paratext, any introductory text that occurs before an introductory section heading marker (\is#) will be lost in the conversion process. To address this issue, place an introductory section heading marker (\is#) immediately after any major title lines. For example:
\h Luke
\toc1 The Gospel according to Luke
\toc2 Luke
\mt2 The Gospel
\mt3 according to
\mt1 LUKE
\is Introduction
\ip This is an introduction paragraph for \bk The Gospel according to LUKE\bk*.

Known issues
Fieldworks TE should be set to single column before export. Pathway will break into multiple columns.
Fieldworks Flex filters don’t affect reversal section.
Libre Office will not allow dashed borders
Libre Office cannot balance double column text when footnotes are on the bottom of the page.
Libre Office has a different list of styles for character styles and paragraph styles. Different kinds of syles (paragraph, character, page, section, etc.) are selected on the tool bar. Word puts all the styles in one list. 
The ability to add extra space between words (the css word-spacing feature) does not exist in Libre Office.
