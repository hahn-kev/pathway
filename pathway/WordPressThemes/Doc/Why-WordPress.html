<P>Reasons we chose WordPress:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A person in the language community
	can make comments about a particular entry. For example, someone
	might say that an entry is missing a sense. Someone authorized to
	make changes to the dictionary can determine if the comment is
	accurate, and if so, can make the appropriate change to the
	dictionary in FLEx. The dictionary can then be uploaded again to the
	web site. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The framework allows different
	language communities using the software to select their own color
	combination and layout, or &quot;theme.&quot; For instance, certain
	colors mean certain things to the Cherokee, and they had definite
	ideas what colors to use for their website. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A search mechanism is built in.
	While this needs to be customized for certain languages, the default
	search should work for many languages, if not most.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are thousands upon thousands
	of WordPress administrators in the world. People administering these
	dictionaries using WordPress stand an excellent chance of finding
	information and tutorials they need online. Just type &quot;WordPress
	admin tutorial&quot; into Google. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Similarly, WordPress has a huge
	programmer base, one of the biggest in the world. If a language
	community doesn't like a theme we have produced, or can't get hold
	of one of us programmers to fix a bug, odds are pretty good they can
	find someone else familiar with WordPress code who can make the
	change. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The use of MySQL is mature and well defined. MySQL also has
	worldwide support, and is well known by web hosting community.</P>
