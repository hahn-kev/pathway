<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I can think of at least six major
differences to Lexique Pro. There may be more:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lexique Pro requires you to
	download all the dictionary entries for a particular letter before
	you can view one entry, which can take a long time if you have a lot
	of entries. The approach we are using allows you to search for a
	single entry, which is much faster. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The approach we are using allows
	others in the language community to make comments about a particular
	entry. For example, someone might say that an entry is missing a
	sense. Someone authorized to make changes to the dictionary can
	determine if the comment is accurate, and if so, can make the
	appropriate change to the dictionary in FLEx. The dictionary can
	then be uploaded again to the web site. (The comment capability is
	currently turned off on the Cherokee site.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pathway integrates directly into
	FieldWorks (or Paratext). This means a user doesn't need to learn a
	new interface, is he does with Lexique Pro. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The framework we are using,
	WordPress (<A HREF="http://wordpress.org/">http://wordpress.org/</A>,
	allows different language communities using the software to select
	their own color combination and layout, or &quot;theme.&quot; For
	instance, certain colors mean certain things to the Cherokee, and
	they had definite ideas what colors to use for their website. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are thousands upon thousands
	of WordPress administrators in the world. People administering these
	dictionaries using WordPress stand an excellent chance of finding
	information and tutorials they need online. Just type &quot;WordPress
	admin tutorial&quot; into Google. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Similarly, WordPress has a huge programmer base, one of the
	biggest in the world. If a language community doesn't like a theme
	we have produced, or can't get hold of one of us programmers to fix
	a bug, odds are pretty good they can find someone else familiar with
	WordPress code who can make the change.
