        <Content>Junction tables, which handle many to many relationships, should be named by concatenating the names of the tables that have a one to many relationship with the junction table. For example, you might have "Provider" and "Patient" tables. Since providers can have many patients and patients can have many providers (specialists) a table is needed to hold the data for those relationships in a junction table. This table should be named ProviderPatient. Since this convention can result in lengthy table names, abbreviations sometimes may be used at your discretion.
