If you don't already have a web site, you can set up a site at one of these links:
http://000space.com/ (paid for by advertizing)
http://www.000webhost.com/ (paid for by advertizing)
http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting.aspx (charges a nominal fee)

(If you would rather set it up on a local machine (not on the internet) or set up a Windows machine to serve the pages in a local area network, you could use XAMPP from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/
Note that XAMPP should be started before skype if they are both to run on the same computer because skype will prevent XAMPP from running)
